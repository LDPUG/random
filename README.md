# Random selecting a winner for "Lviv Data Platform User Group" meetups

The main idea of this project it's to create scripts on different data platforms to easily select random winners for "Lviv Data Platform User Group" meetups.

## Main rules:
1. It should be easy to run a script and import a list of registered users;
2. A user can be selected only one time per a meetup raffle;
3. The algorithm to select a winner should be random.
